# Okenaba — High-Level Business Overview

## 1. Business Idea
**Okenaba** is a platform-agnostic digital receipt system that helps **buyers and sellers close an online transaction with one final, shared receipt**.

It works for any deal agreed online (chat apps, social platforms, email) and focuses on **closure, clarity, and trust** — not payments or enforcement.

---

## 2. Problem
Online transactions often suffer from:
- No official or shared receipt
- Reliance on chat screenshots as proof
- Confusion after payment or delivery
- Buyers and sellers having different versions of “what was agreed”

This leads to mistrust, anxiety, and unnecessary disputes.

---

## 3. Solution
Okenaba provides:
- A **single digital receipt**
- Viewable by both buyer and seller
- With clear details and timestamps
- That becomes **final and immutable** once confirmed

This gives both parties confidence that:
> “Okay na ba? — Okenaba.”
